notes on week 1 section 1:

Regression/Estimation: Predicting continuous values (price of house)
Classification: Predicting the item class/category of a case (benign or malignant)
Clustering: Finding the structure of data; summarization (finding similar patients)
Associations: Associating frequent co-occurring events/items (grocery items bought together)

Anomaly Detection: abnormal and unusual cases (like Fraud)
Sequence Mining: Predicting next events
Dimension Reduction: Reducing the size of data (PCA)
Recommendation Systems: Recommending items


Top Libraries for ML in Python:
  Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and most importantly Scikit Learn (works with Scipy and Numpy, and is easy to implement

The order is to clean data, split it into testing and training, use the model with the training data, and then test it

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:
  Supervised -> We train the model by labeling data
  Popular techniques -> Classification ( predict category )
                     -> Regression ( Predict numerical value )

Data can be numerical or categorical.

  Unsupervised -> trained by unlabeled data
  Popular techniques -> Dimension reduction ( removing redundant elements )
                     -> Density Estimation ( Final Structure )
                     -> Market Basket Analysis ( if you buy this product, most probably you're gonna buy these products )
                     -> Clustering ( Grouping the similar data )
