Linear regression:
There are 1 or more independent variables & 1 dependent variable (has to be continuous, not discrete) called Goal or Result.
Simple regression: 1 (independent) to 1 (dependent) and can be (linear/non-Linear)
Multiple Regression: more than 1 (independent) to 1 (dependent) and can be (linear/non-Linear)
Examples: sales forecasting, employment income, price estimation

Simple Linear Regression:
Y hat = θ0 + θ1 * X1
Y hat is the response variable
Theta 0 is the intercept
Theta 1 is the slope
X1 is the independent variable

We aim for finding the line on the graph which has the least error error is the (actual value - line’s value) for a x, the less the better also called Mean Square Error (MSE) = 1/n ∑i=1 to n (yi - y”hat”i)squared

Θ0 = ybar - θ1 * xbar
Θ1 = (∑i=1 to 3 (xi - x”bar”)*(yi - y”bar”))/∑i=1 to 3 (xi - x”bar”)squared

Pros of linear regression:
Very fast
No parameter tuning
Easy to understand and highly interpretable
